    Dear Zina,<br>

I just wanted to take a moment to write to you because, even though we see each other often, sometimes a letter can say things that conversations don't. First of all, I hope you're doing well and that your days have been filled with happiness and laughter.

Since we live so close, it's easy to take for granted how lucky we are to have each other just a few steps away. Not everyone has that kind of bond with their cousin, and I truly appreciate you in my life. You've always been someone I can count on, whether it's for a deep conversation, a good laugh, or just someone to sit with in comfortable silence.

Lately, I've been thinking about how important it is to make time for the people who matter most, and you're definitely one of those people. We should plan something fun , a movie night, or just a simple day out (bghit chwa wlh). Let's make more memories to add to our already long list!

Until then, just know that we're always here for you, and I'm grateful for the bond we share. Sending you lots of love and looking forward to seeing you soon (which, luckily, won't be long at all because i live literally right next to you).
<br>
With love, <br>
Badr</p>

<p id="letter2">I love how we always find a way to meet up, no matter how busy life gets. It's those little moments that mean the most, and I cherish every single one. You bring so much joy and positivity wherever you go, and I hope this year brings you all the happiness, love, and success you deserve.

    Here's to another year of adventures, laughter, and unforgettable memories together. I can't wait to celebrate with you and make even more amazing moments!
    
    Wishing you the happiest of birthdays, today and always.</p>
